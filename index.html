A quick jot down of stuff. Just getting started. Need to fix some parts of the code. More analytics will be added later!

<ul>
	<li>Keeps track of badminton doubles data and has some analytics.</li>
	<li>Elo rating: Assigns elo rating for individual players. In general, the main point with elo rating is that it gives importance to the strength of the opposition. If one wins against a weaker opposition, they get lesser points. On the other side, if one wins against a stronger opposition, they get more points.</li>
	<li>Main idea is as follows. More details later.</li>
	<ul>
	<li>All individuals begin with an elo of 1500 (Why? GOK; Initial value doesn't matter; some baseline value).</li>
	<li>Team 1 (T1) consist of players P1 and P2; Team 2 (T2) consist of players P3 and P4.</li>
	<li>T1 elo is 0.5*(elo(P1)+elo(P2)) and T2 elo is 0.5*(elo(P1)+elo(P2)).</li>
	<li>Let's also assume that elo(T1)>elo(T2), i.e., T1 are the favourites to win.</li>
	<li>Assume the score of the losing team is 'D' points.</li>
	<li>The elochange is calculated as follows:</li>

	\[EL = K \exp(-\lvert elo(T1)-elo(T2) \rvert /a/K)(1-D/100)\]

	<li>If T1 wins, then each member of T1 gets the above points added to their score and each member of T2 have the above points subtracted from their score.</li>

	<li>If T2 wins, then each member of T2 gets \((K(1-D/100)-EL)\) points added to their score and each member of T1 have the \((K(1-D/100)-EL)\) points subtracted from their score.</li>

	<li>Another feature of the above specific elo rating is that it also gives importance to the margin of victory via the factor \((1-D/100)\). If the losing team scores 0 points, then the swing factor (elochange) is higher. If the losing team scores \(20\) points, then the swing factor (elochange) is lower.</li>
</ul>

<li>Some things to note:</li>

<ul><li> Rounding the elochange has a reasonable effect on the scores (though not catastrophic). For the uninitiated, see how rounding affects computations <li> <a href="https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~arnold/disasters/patriot.html">Patriot Missile Failure</a></li>

</li>

<li>One can debate about what precise elochange function one has to choose. In chess typically, a higher 'K' value is used for initial games and then a lower 'K' value is used for subsequent games to slot individuals in their "right" rating range.</li>
</ul>
