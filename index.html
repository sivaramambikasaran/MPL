Keeps track of badminton doubles data and has some analytics. Just getting started. More to be tweaked and added.

Elo rating: Assigns elo rating based for individual players. Main idea is as follows.

All individuals begin with an elo of 1500 (Why? GOK).

Team 1 (T1) consist of players P1 and P2; Team 2 (T2) consist of players P3 and P4.

T1 elo is 0.5*(elo(P1)+elo(P2)) and T2 elo is 0.5*(elo(P1)+elo(P2)).

Let's also assume that elo(T1)>elo(T2), i.e., T1 are the favourites to win.

Assume the score of the losing team is 'D' points.

The elochange is

EL = K*exp(-abs(elo(T1)-elo(T2))/a/K)*(1-D/100);

If T1 wins, then each member of T1 gets the above points added to their score and each member of T2 have the above points subtracted from their score.

If T2 wins, then each member of T2 gets (K*(1-D/100)-EL) points added to their score and each member of T1 have the (K*(1-D/100)-EL) points subtracted from their score.

In general, the main point with elo rating is that it gives importance to the strength of the opposition. If one wins against a weaker opposition, they get lesser points. On the other side, if one wins against a stronger opposition, they get more points.

Another feature of the above specific elo rating is that it also gives importance to the margin of victory via the factor (1-D/100). If the losing team scores 0 points, then the swing factor (elochange) is higher. If the losing team scores 20 points, then the swing factor (elochange) is lower.

Some things to note:

(i) Rounding the elochange has a reasonable effect on the scores; Not surprising.
