Keeps track of badminton doubles data and has some analytics. Just getting started. More to be tweaked and added.

Elo rating: Assigns elo rating based for individual players. Main idea is as follows.

All individuals begin with an elo of 1500 (Why? GOK).

Team 1 (T1) consist of players P1 and P2; Team 2 (T2) consist of players P3 and P4.

T1 elo is 0.5*(elo(P1)+elo(P2)) and T2 elo is 0.5*(elo(P1)+elo(P2)).

Let's also assume that elo(T1)>elo(T2), i.e., T1 are the favourites to win.

Assume the score of the losing team is 'D' points.

The elochange is

EL = K*exp(-abs(elo(T1)-elo(T2))/a/K)*(1-D/100);

If T1 wins, then each member of T1 gets the above points added to their score and each member of T2 have the above points subtracted from their score.

If T2 wins, then each member of T2 gets (K*(1-D/100)-EL) points added to their score and each member of T1 have the (K*(1-D/100)-EL) points subtracted from their score.

In general, the main point with elo rating is that it gives importance to the strength of the opposition. If one wins against a weaker opposition, they get lesser points. On the other side, if one wins against a stronger opposition, they get more points.
